# foobar Challenge

Something pretty fun I found googling. These are small coding challenges and algorithms in Python for the foobar challenge by Google.

If you are participating too, you may find different challenges than the ones I faced, I think they are assigned randomly.
Anyway, where is the fun if you copy the solution? Get out of here and solve them on your own!

To learn more, visit [the foobar website](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/).

Also, apparently some people have found a job thanks to this game
